hack-on-games is a repository created mainly for the
'Hacktoberfest' event.

The idea is to write a game in your favourite programming language.
The games we choose are:
    - Hangman
    - Guess game
    - Tic-Tac-Toe
    - Game of life

# Contributing

Contributing is fairly easy and can be done in few steps:
- Clone this repo
- Checkout to a new branch
- Create a folder under games/<game> with your username on GitHub
- Write the game, commit, push, create a PR

We strongly encourage writing a game in a language you are not familiar with.
