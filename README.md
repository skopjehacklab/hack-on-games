## hack-on-games

hack-on-games is a repository created mainly for the
'Hacktoberfest' event.

The idea is to write a game in your favourite programming language, but we strongly encourage to write it in a language you are not familiar with.

Two things before starting:
* Choose a game
* Choose a programming language

Some of the games we could've think of are:

* Hangman
* Guess game
* Tic-Tac-Toe
* Game of life
* Rolling the dice
* Pong
* Snake
* Tron

The language is up to you.

## Contributing

Contributing is fairly easy and can be done in few steps:
* Clone this repo
* Checkout to a new branch
* Create a folder under games/<game> with your username on GitHub
* Write the game, commit, push, create a PR
* If your game is not finished, mark the PR with [WIP] in the
title, as well as 'DO NOT MERGE' label.

We strongly encourage writing a game in a language you are not familiar with.
